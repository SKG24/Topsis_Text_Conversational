# Model Evaluation and Ranking Using TOPSIS
This project evaluates and ranks a set of pre-trained language models (GPT-2, T5, and BART) based on several performance criteria. We use the TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method to rank the models based on their overall performance across multiple metrics.

### Introduction
In this project, we evaluate language models based on:

- Accuracy: Simulated accuracy score for how well the model is performing.
- Response Speed: Average time taken for generating a response.
- Memory Usage: Approximate memory usage based on the number of model parameters.
- F1 Score: A simulated F1 score based on the predicted and true labels.
- Diversity Score: A simulated diversity score based on the variety of responses generated.
We then apply TOPSIS to rank these models according to their overall performance, considering all the criteria.

### Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

- Accuracy: Measures how close the model's output is to the expected output.
- Response Speed (s): Measures the average time taken by the model to generate a response.
- Memory Usage (MB): Approximate memory usage based on the number of parameters in the model.
- F1 Score: Measures the harmonic mean of precision and recall based on simulated responses.
- Diversity Score: Simulated score that indicates the variety of responses generated by the model.
### TOPSIS Method
TOPSIS is a multi-criteria decision-making method used to rank alternatives based on their relative closeness to an ideal solution. It is particularly useful when multiple criteria need to be considered, and the goal is to identify the most optimal model based on multiple factors.

- Ideal Solution: The best possible value for each criterion (e.g., highest accuracy, lowest response time).
Negative Ideal Solution: The worst possible value for each criterion (e.g., lowest accuracy, highest response time).
The models are ranked based on their distance from these ideal and negative ideal solutions, and the TOPSIS score is calculated as:

### Steps Involved
- Data Collection: Collect performance metrics (accuracy, response speed, memory usage, F1 score, and diversity score) for each model.
- Normalization: Normalize the data to scale all metrics between 0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler.
- Ideal and Negative Ideal Solutions: Identify the ideal (maximum) and negative ideal (minimum) solutions for each metric.
- Euclidean Distance Calculation: Calculate the Euclidean distance from each model's normalized scores to the ideal and negative ideal solutions.
- TOPSIS Score Calculation: Compute the TOPSIS score for each model based on the distances.
- Ranking: Rank the models based on their TOPSIS scores.
